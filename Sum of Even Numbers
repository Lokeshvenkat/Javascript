Problem Description
You are required to implement a recursive function that calculates the sum of even numbers from 1 to a given positive integer n.

Input format
The input consists of a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^4), representing the upper limit of the range.

Output format
Return the sum of even numbers from 1 to n.

Sample Input 1
10

Sample Output 1
30

Explanation
The even numbers from 1 to 10 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The sum is 2+4+6+8+10 = 30.

Sample Input 2
7

Sample Output 2
12

Explanation
The even numbers from 1 to 7 are 2, 4, and 6. The sum is 2+4+6 = 12.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^4

function sumOfEvenNumbersDSAMOCK(n) {
    let sum=0;
     if(n<=3){
         return 2;
     } 
     if(n%2==0){
         sum+=n;
         //return sum+sumOfEvenNumbersDSAMOCK(n-1);
     }
   return sum+sumOfEvenNumbersDSAMOCK(n-1);
}

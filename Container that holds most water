Problem Description
You are given an array of N non-negative integers where each represents the height of a line. N vertical lines are drawn at points marked 1 to n on the x axis as shown in the diagram. Find two lines, which together with the x axis forms a container, such that the container holds the most water. Assume the width of lines to be negligible.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

Input format
The first line consists of an integer, N, denoting the size of the array.

The second line consists of N space separated integers which denote the elements of the array,

Output format
Single integer denoting the capacity of the largest container.

Constraints
2 <= N <= 10^6

function maxArea(height) {

    let left =0;
    let right=height.length-1;
    let maxarea=0;

   while(left<right){

       let minHeight=Math.min(height[left],height[right]);
    let product = minHeight*(right-left);

       if(product>maxarea){
           maxarea=product;
       } else if(height[left] < height[right]){
           left++;
           }
           else{
           right--;
       } 
   }
